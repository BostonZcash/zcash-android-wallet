# zcash-android-wallet
Android wallet using the Zcash Android SDK that is maintained by core developers.

There are some known areas for improvement:

- Traffic analysis, like in other cryptocurrency wallets, can leak some privacy
  of the user.
- The wallet might display inaccurate transaction information if it is connected
  to an untrustworthy server.

See the [Wallet App Threat
Model](https://zcash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rtd_pages/wallet_threat_model.html)
for more information about the security and privacy limitations of the wallet.
